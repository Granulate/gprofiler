# prepares the environment for building py-spy:
# 1. installs the rust target $(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl - this can build static binaries
# 2. downloads, builds & installs libunwind with musl
# 2. downloads, builds & installs libz with musl
# I use musl because it builds statically. otherwise, we need to build with old glibc; I tried to
# build on centos:7 but it caused some errors out-of-the-box (libunwind was built w/o -fPIC and rust tried
# to build it as shared (?))
# in any way, building it static solves all issues. and I find it better to use more recent versions of libraries
# like libunwind/zlib.
