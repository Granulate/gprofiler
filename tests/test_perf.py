    Runs a program that changes its comm (i.e comm of the main thread).

    https://github.com/Granulate/linux/commit/40a7823cf90a7e69ce8af88d224dfdd7e371de2d

    perf records "comm" events - changes of task comms. Samples printed for a thread will use the current comm
    perf understands that it has. Our modification makes it select a PERF_RECORD_COMM event that has the "exec"
    flag. Below are 2 events from the native program - the first is the name it was executed with, then
    the rename. If perf has started before the app, we expect to see the exec name and not the current name.

    I'm not sure it can be done, i.e is this info even kept anywhere).
