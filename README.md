# gProfiler
gProfiler combines multiple sampling profilers to produce unified visualization of
what your CPU is spending time on, displaying stack traces of your processes
across native programs<sup id="a1">[1](#perf-native)</sup> (includes Golang), Java and Python runtimes, and kernel routines.

gProfiler can upload its results to the [Granulate Performance Studio](https://profiler.granulate.io/), which aggregates the results from different instances over different periods of time and can give you a holistic view of what is happening on your entire cluster.
To upload results, you will have to register and generate a token on the website.

gProfiler runs on Linux (on x86_64 and Aarch64; Aarch64 support is not complete yet and not all runtime profilers are supported, see [architecture support](#architecture-support)).

![Granulate Performance Studio example view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58514213/124375504-36b0b200-dcab-11eb-8d64-caf20687a29f.gif)

# Running

This section describes the possible options to control gProfiler's output, and the various execution modes (as a container, as an executable, etc...)

## Output options

gProfiler can produce output in two ways:

* Create an aggregated, collapsed stack samples file (`profile_<timestamp>.col`)
  and a flamegraph file (`profile_<timestamp>.html`). Two symbolic links (`last_profile.col` and `last_flamegraph.html`) always point to the last output files.

  Use the `--output-dir`/`-o` option to specify the output directory.

  If `--rotating-output` is given, only the last results are kept (available via `last_profle.col` and `last_flamegraph.html`). This can be used to avoid increasing gProfiler's disk usage over time. Useful in conjunction with `--upload-results` (explained ahead) - historical results are available in the Granulate Performance Studio, and the very latest results are available locally.

  `--no-flamegraph` can be given to avoid generation of the `profile_<timestamp>.html` file - only the collapsed stack samples file will be created.

* Send the results to the Granulate Performance Studio for viewing online with
  filtering, insights, and more.

  Use the `--upload-results`/`-u` flag. Pass the `--token` option to specify the token
  provided by Granulate Performance Studio, and the `--service-name` option to specify an identifier
  for the collected profiles, as will be viewed in the [Granulate Performance Studio](https://profiler.granulate.io/). *Profiles sent from numerous
  gProfilers using the same service name will be aggregated together.*

Note: both flags can be used simultaneously, in which case gProfiler will create the local files *and* upload
the results.

## Profiling options
* `--profiling-frequency`: The sampling frequency of the profiling, in *hertz*.
* `--profiling-duration`: The duration of the each profiling session, in *seconds*.

The default profiling frequency is *11 hertz*. Using higher frequency will lead to more accurate results, but will create greater overhead on the profiled system & programs.

For each profiling session (each profiling duration), gProfiler produces outputs (writing local files and/or uploading the results to the Granulate Performance Studio).

### Java profiling options

* `--no-java` or `--java-mode disabled`: Disable profilers for Java.
* `--no-java-async-profiler-buildids`: Disable embedding of buildid+offset in async-profiler native frames (used when debug symbols are unavailable).

### Python profiling options
* `--no-python`: Alias of `--python-mode disabled`.
* `--python-mode`: Controls which profiler is used for Python.
    * `auto` - (default) try with PyPerf (eBPF), fall back to py-spy.
    * `pyperf` - Use PyPerf with no py-spy fallback.
    * `pyspy` - Use py-spy.
    * `disabled` - Disable profilers for Python.

Profiling using eBPF incurs lower overhead & provides kernel stacks. This (currently) requires kernel headers to be installed.

### PHP profiling options
* `--no-php` or `--php-mode disabled`: Disable profilers for PHP.
* `--php-proc-filter`: Process filter (`pgrep`) to select PHP processes for profiling (this is phpspy's `-P` option)

### Ruby profiling options
* `--no-ruby` or `--ruby-mode disabled`: Disable profilers for Ruby.

### NodeJS profiling options
* `--nodejs-mode`: Controls which profiler is used for NodeJS.
     * `none` - (default) no profiler is used.
     * `perf` - augment the system profiler (`perf`) results with jitdump files generated by NodeJS. This requires running your `node` processes with `--perf-prof` (and for Node >= 10, with `--interpreted-frames-native-stack`). See this [NodeJS page](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/diagnostics-flamegraph/) for more information.

### System profiling options

* `--perf-mode`: Controls the global perf strategy. Must be one of the following options:
    * `fp` - Use Frame Pointers for the call graph
    * `dwarf` - Use DWARF for the call graph (adds the `--call-graph dwarf` argument to the `perf` command)
    * `smart` - Run both `fp` and `dwarf`, then choose the result with the highest average of stack frames count, per process.
    * `disabled` - Avoids running `perf` at all. See [perf-less mode](#perf-less-mode).

## Other options
### Sending logs to server
**By default, gProfiler sends logs to Granulate Performance Studio** (when using `--upload-results`/`-u` flag)
This behavior can be disabled by passing `--dont-send-logs` or the setting environment variable `GPROFILER_DONT_SEND_LOGS=1`.

### Metrics and metadata collection
By default, gProfiler agent sends system metrics (CPU and RAM usage) and metadata to the Performance Studio.
The metadata includes system metadata like the kernel version and CPU count, and cloud metadata like the type of the instance you are running on.
The metrics collection will not be enabled if the `--upload-results`/`-u` flag is not set.
Otherwise, you can disable metrics and metadata by using the following parameters:
* Use `--disable-metrics-collection` to disable metrics collection
* Use `--disable-metadata-collection` to disable metadata collection

### Continuous mode
gProfiler can be run in a continuous mode, profiling periodically, using the `--continuous`/`-c` flag.
Note that when using `--continuous` with `--output-dir`, a new file will be created during *each* sampling interval.
Aggregations are only available when uploading to the Granulate Performance Studio.

## Running as a Docker container
Supported both for x86_64 and Aarch64.

Run the following to have gProfiler running continuously, uploading to Granulate Performance Studio:
```bash
docker pull granulate/gprofiler:latest
docker run --name granulate-gprofiler -d --restart=on-failure:10 \
    --pid=host --userns=host --privileged \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
	granulate/gprofiler:latest -cu --token <token> --service-name <service> [options]
```

For profiling with eBPF, kernel headers must be accessible from within the container at
`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build`. On Ubuntu, this directory is a symlink pointing to `/usr/src`.
The command above mounts both of these directories.

## Running as an executable
Supported only on x86_64!

Run the following to have gprofiler running continuously, uploading to Granulate Performance Studio:
```bash
wget https://github.com/Granulate/gprofiler/releases/latest/download/gprofiler
sudo chmod +x gprofiler
sudo ./gprofiler -cu --token <token> --service-name <service> [options]
```

gProfiler unpacks executables to `/tmp` by default; if your `/tmp` is marked with `noexec`,
you can add `TMPDIR=/proc/self/cwd` to have everything unpacked in your current working directory.
```bash
sudo TMPDIR=/proc/self/cwd ./gprofiler -cu --token <token> --service-name <service> [options]
```

#### Executable known issues
The following platforms are currently not supported with the gProfiler executable:
+ Alpine

**Remark:** container-based execution works and can be used in those cases.

## Running as a Kubernetes DaemonSet
See [gprofiler.yaml](deploy/k8s/gprofiler.yaml) for a basic template of a DaemonSet running gProfiler.
Make sure to insert the `GPROFILER_TOKEN` and `GPROFILER_SERVICE` variables in the appropriate location!

## Running as an ECS (Elastic Container Service) Daemon service
See [gprofiler_task_definition.json](deploy/ecs/gprofiler_task_definition.json) for a basic template of a Task Definition which runs gProfiler.
Make sure to replace `<CLIENT TOKEN>` and `<CLIENT SERVICE>` with your appropriate token and service name!
Also make sure to deploy it as an EC2 launch type, and as a Daemon service type - <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oaDR51w.png" alt="ecs-deployment" width="50%"/> \
Note - if you wish to see the logs from the gProfiler service, be sure to follow [AWS's guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_awslogs.html#create_awslogs_loggroups)
on how to auto-configure logging, or to set it up manually yourself.

## Running from source
gProfiler requires Python 3.6+ to run.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/copy_resources_from_image.sh
```

Then, run the following **as root**:
```bash
python3 -m gprofiler [options]
```

# Theory of operation
gProfiler invokes `perf` in system wide mode, collecting profiling data for all running processes.
Alongside `perf`, gProfiler invokes runtime-specific profilers for processes based on these environments:
* Java runtimes (version 7+) based on the HotSpot JVM, including the Oracle JDK and other builds of OpenJDK like AdoptOpenJDK and Azul Zulu.
  * Uses async-profiler.
* The CPython interpreter, versions 2.7 and 3.5-3.9.
  * eBPF profiling (based on PyPerf) requires Linux 4.14 or higher; see [Python profiling options](#python-profiling-options) for more info.
  * If eBPF is not available for whatever reason, py-spy is used.
* PHP (Zend Engine), versions 7.0-8.0.
  * Uses [Granulate's fork](https://github.com/Granulate/phpspy/) of the phpspy project.
* Ruby versions (versions 1.9.1 to 3.0.1)
  * Uses [Granulate's fork](https://github.com/Granulate/rbspy) of the [rbspy](https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy) profiler.
* NodeJS (version >= 10 for functioning `--perf-prof`):
  * Uses `perf inject --jit` and NodeJS's ability to generate jitdump files. See [NodeJS profiling options](#nodejs-profiling-options).

The runtime-specific profilers produce stack traces that include runtime information (i.e, stacks of Java/Python functions), unlike `perf` which produces native stacks of the JVM / CPython interpreter.
The runtime stacks are then merged into the data collected by `perf`, substituting the *native* stacks `perf` has collected for those processes.

## Architecture support

| Runtime                    | x86_64             | Aarch64            |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| perf (native, Golang, ...) | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Java (async-profiler)      | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python (py-spy)            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Python (PyPerf eBPF)       | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                |
| Ruby (rbspy)               | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| PHP (phpspy)               | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                |
| NodeJS (perf)              | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

## perf-less mode

It is possible to run gProfiler without using `perf` - this is useful where `perf` can't be used, for whatever reason (e.g permissions). This mode is enabled by `--perf-mode disabled`.

In this mode, gProfiler uses runtime-specific profilers only, and their results are concatenated (instead of scaled into the results collected by `perf`). This means that, although the results from different profilers are viewed on the same graph, they are not necessarily of the same scale: so you can compare the samples count of Java to Java, but not Java to Python.
